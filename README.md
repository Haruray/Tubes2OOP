# IF2210 Project Template

Here is an example of project using gradle as the build tools.
Try running these commands:

`./gradlew run`

You will notice that it will open a window that display 'Minecraft: Aether Wars'.
In the command line you can see the data that is being read by `CSVReader.java`

What happen is when you use `./gradlew run`, it will start the main function in your app.
For this app, the main function lives in `AetherWars.java`.

You can explore more about gradle [here](https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/)

## JDK

As of the creation of this template, the assistant team used and tested the JDK 8 installation from OpenJDK and Amazon Corretto (since JavaFX is readily available on those installations). You can easily pick and install your desired JDK version and variant by doing it via an IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
